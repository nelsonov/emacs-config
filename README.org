* Lee's Emacs Configuration

In *~/.emacs.d*

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:nelsonov/emacs-config.git
#+END_SRC

** Included/Ignored

*.gitignore* is setup so that only certain files are included.  All other files
will be ignored by git.

***Included

 + ~.gitignore~
 + ~init.el~
 + ~*.org~ Any file ending in .org (Like this current file)
 + ~themes/*.el~ Only files ending in ~.el~ in the themes subdirectory
 + ~custom/*.el~ Only files ending in ~.el~ in the custom subdirectory 

** custom subdirectory
Rather than having a single, huge, monolithic ~init.el~, much of the
configuration has been broken out into individule files.  They are called
from ~init.el~ with a ~require~ statement:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'setup-something)
#+END_SRC

This tells emacs to look for a file called ~setup-something.el~ in the *load path*

The ~setup-something.el~ file must end with a ~provide~ statement:

The ~custom~ subidrectory must be added the *load path* in ~init.el~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/custom")
#+END_SRC
